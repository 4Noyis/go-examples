Example projects for Golang

### Project 1

Hello World

### Project 2

Values types in Go

### Project 3

Variables in Golang

### Project 4

Constants

### Project 5

Only looping construct in Go "for"

### Project 6

if/else

### Project 7

Switch

### Project 8

Arrays

### Project 9

Slices

### Project 10

Maps: `Maps are Go’s built-in associative data type
(sometimes called hashes or dicts in other languages).`

### Project 11

Functions

### Project 12

Multi Return

### Project 13

Variadic Functions: `Variadic functions can be called with any number of trailing arguments.`

### Project 14

Closures: `Define a function inline without having to name it.`

### Project 15

Range

### Project 16

Pointers : `Allowing you to pass references to values and records within your program.`

### Project 17

Runes: `In other languages, strings are made of “characters”. In Go, the concept of a character is called a rune - it’s an integer that represents a Unicode code point. `

### Project 18

Structs: `Go’s structs are typed collections of fields. They’re useful for grouping data together to form records.`

### Project 19

Methods: `Go supports methods defined on struct types.`

### Project 20

Interfaces: `Interfaces are named collections of method signatures.`

### Project 21

Enums

### Project 22

Struct Embedding

### Project 23

Errors

### Project 24

Goroutines: `A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution.`

### Project 25

Channels: `Channels are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines. You can send values into channels from one goroutine and receive those values into another goroutine.`

### Project 26

Channel Buffering: `By default channels are unbuffered, meaning that they will only accept sends (chan <-) if there is a corresponding receive (<- chan) ready to receive the sent value. Buffered channels accept a limited number of values without a corresponding receiver for those values.`

### Project 27

Channel Synchronization: `We can use channels to synchronize execution across goroutines.`

### Project 28

Channel Directions

### Project 29

Select: `Go’s select lets you wait on multiple channel operations. Combining goroutines and channels with select is a powerful feature of Go.`

### Project 30

Timeouts

### Project 31

Timers

### Project 32

Tickers: `Timers are for when you want to do something once in the future - tickers are for when you want to do something repeatedly at regular intervals. `
